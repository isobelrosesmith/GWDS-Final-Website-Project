        <h1>Typography Tasks</h1>
        <div class="navigation-menu">
            <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/axial-1.png" alt="Typography 1" width="300px" height="300px">
                <h4>Axial</h4>
                <p> For this design I divided my text with a diagonal line, i placed more text on the bottom half to balance out the weight of the black section. I chose to use the colour red as it is bold and stands out on both the white and black. </p>
        
        </div>


        <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Bilateral-1.png" alt="Typography 2" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Bilateral</h4>
            <p> Bilateral typography demonstrates symmetry and centered text, therefore i split my image in the middle and chose to alternate the colour of the text on either side to show contrast.</p>
        
        </div>

        <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Dilatational-1.png" alt="Typography 3" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Dilatational</h4>
            <p> In Dilatational typography text is placed along circular paths forming curves. I typed along the edge of circles for accuracy and chose black as the background for dramatic effect.</p>
             
        </div>

        <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Grid-1.png" alt="Typography 4" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Grid</h4>
            <p> In this grid design the text fits neatly into collums making it easy for the viewer to read with little distraction. I changed some font sizes to show hierachy within this outcome.</p>

         </div>

         <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Modular-1.png" alt="Typography 5" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Modular</h4>
            <p> Repeated strucures such as my use of circles and boxes break up the text within modular typography. I also alternated the text colours to emphasise this.</p>

         </div>
         
         <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Radial-1.png" alt="Typography 6" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Radial</h4>
            <p> This outcome is my favourite as the text flows out from one main focal point, i chose for this point to be central as it makes the text easier to read and is aesthetically pleasing. </p>
            
         </div>

         <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/transitional-1.png" alt="Typography 7" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Transitional</h4>
            <p> Transitional typography plays around with disorganisation, the text can either line up or go in different directions. I placed the longer piece of text in the middle to make it easier to read.</p>

         </div>

         <div class="Typo"><img src="Typo-task/Random-1.png" alt="Typography 8" width="300px" height="300px">
            <h4>Random</h4>
            <p> Finally, for my random typography i experimented with the use of curved text, shapes and lines to break up the piece. I found this design the most fun to create as there are no boundries or rules.</p>

         </div>
         

    
         <div id="Carp.html" class="Carp.html"></div>
         <h1>Carp Task</h1>

    <div class="navigation-menu">
        <div class="carp1"><img src="Carp-task/CARP-1-1.png" alt="Carp 1" width="300px" height="400px">
            <h4>Poster 1</h4>
            <p> For my first poster design I repeated the use of blue shown within the image and placed a black barrier with the most important information to split the poster and information up. I used vertical text to show height and depth within the design in relation to the festival, representing the balloons floating upwards. The three horizontal sections contrast well with the vertical text.</p>

            <div class="carp2"><img src="Carp-task/CARP-2-1.png" alt="Carp 2" width="300px" height="400px">
                <h4>Poster 2</h4>
                <p> For my second design I used triangular shapes with the images inside to show repetion and placed the information on diagonal triangles along the side to balance the design, these show alignment within my outcome. I chose red as the main colour as it is bold, engaging and grabs a viewers attention.</p>

                <div class="carp3"><img src="Carp-task/CARP-3-1.png" alt="Carp 3" width="300px" height="400px">
                    <h4>Poster 3</h4>
                    <p> Lastly, I demonstrated repetition throughout this design through the use of circles and curved text along the circular paths. The use of pink and blue is effective as they are contrasting colours and work well together. The logo for the event is placed on its own in a big text size so that it is the first thing that the viewers eyesight will go to.</p>
